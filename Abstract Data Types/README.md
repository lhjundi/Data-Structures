# Abstract Data Types (ADT)

According to Sedgewick (2002), "An abstract data type (ADT) is a data type (a set of values and a collection of operations on those values) that is accessed only through an interface. We refer to a program that uses an ADT as a client, and a program that specifies the data type as an implementation" (p. 128).
